Description: LSB Steganography Tool with AES Encryption
 StegX is a command-line tool for hiding files within images using
 the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique. It enhances
 security by encrypting the hidden data using AES-256-GCM and ensures
 data integrity.
 .
 Features:
  * Hide any type of file within a cover image
  * Extract hidden files from stego-images
  * AES-256-GCM encryption for secure data hiding
  * Supports PNG, BMP and other image formats
  * Data compression to maximize storage capacity
