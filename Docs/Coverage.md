# Coverage Improvement Tips and Kali Linux Considerations

This document provides guidance on improving test coverage for StegX and addresses specific considerations for testing in a Kali Linux environment.

## Test Coverage Improvement Tips

### 1. Code Coverage Analysis

- **Use coverage tools**: Implement `pytest-cov` or similar tools to measure code coverage:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=stegx_core tests/
  ```

- **Set coverage targets**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage overall, with higher targets (90%+) for critical modules like crypto and steganography.

- **Identify uncovered code**: Regularly review coverage reports to identify untested code paths, particularly error handling branches.

### 2. Mutation Testing

- **Implement mutation testing**: Use tools like `mutmut` or `cosmic-ray` to verify that tests can detect code changes:
  ```bash
  pip install mutmut
  mutmut run --paths-to-mutate stegx_core/
  ```

- **Focus on critical functions**: Prioritize mutation testing for security-critical functions in the crypto module.

### 3. Property-Based Testing

- **Add property-based tests**: Use libraries like `hypothesis` to generate diverse test inputs:
  ```python
  from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
  
  @given(data=st.binary(min_size=1, max_size=1000))
  def test_encrypt_decrypt_property(data):
      password = "test_password"
      encrypted = encrypt_data(data, password)
      decrypted = decrypt_data(encrypted, password)
      assert decrypted == data
  ```

- **Test invariants**: Define and test properties that should always hold true regardless of inputs.

### 4. Boundary Testing Expansion

- **Expand boundary tests**: Add more tests at the boundaries of valid input ranges:
  - Files of exactly the maximum supported size
  - Images with minimum dimensions that can store data
  - Passwords at minimum/maximum length limits

- **Test resource limits**: Add tests for behavior under resource constraints (low memory, disk space).

### 5. Negative Testing Enhancement

- **Enhance negative testing**: Add more tests for invalid inputs and error conditions:
  - Malformed image files (partially corrupted)
  - Interrupted operations (simulate power loss during encoding/decoding)
  - Race conditions in file operations

### 6. Integration Test Expansion

- **Add cross-module integration tests**: Test interactions between modules that aren't directly connected.

- **Test configuration variations**: Test with different combinations of options (compression on/off, different image modes).

## Kali Linux-Specific Considerations

### 1. Security Testing in Kali Environment

- **Test with Kali security tools**: Use Kali's built-in tools to analyze StegX:
  ```bash
  bandit -r stegx_project/
  
  graudit stegx_project/
  ```

- **Test against steganalysis tools**: Verify resistance against steganalysis tools available in Kali:
  ```bash
  apt-get install stegdetect
  
  stegdetect -t p output_stego_image.png
  ```

### 2. Privilege Escalation Testing

- **Test with different privilege levels**: Verify behavior when run as different users:
  ```python
  def test_privilege_handling():
      # Test with elevated privileges (if applicable)
      # Test with restricted privileges
  ```

- **Test file permission handling**: Verify proper handling of files with restricted permissions.

### 3. Kali-Specific Deployment Testing

- **Test installation in Kali environment**: Verify the Debian package installs correctly in Kali:
  ```bash
  dpkg -i stegx_1.1.0.deb

  dpkg -l | grep steg
  ```

- **Test integration with Kali workflow**: Verify StegX works well with other Kali tools:
  ```python
  def test_kali_workflow_integration():
      # Test using output from other tools as input
      # Test providing output to other tools
  ```

### 4. Penetration Testing Scenarios

- **Test in realistic scenarios**: Create tests that simulate real penetration testing use cases:
  ```python
  def test_pentest_scenario():
      # Hide sensitive data in an innocuous image
      # Transfer the image through a monitored channel
      # Extract the data on the other side
  ```

- **Test with actual target file types**: Use common file types found during penetration testing (screenshots, network captures).

### 5. Anti-Forensics Considerations

- **Test forensic resistance**: Verify that StegX doesn't leave unnecessary artifacts:
  ```python
  def test_forensic_artifacts():
      # Check for temporary files
      # Check for metadata leakage
      # Check for memory artifacts
  ```

- **Test secure deletion**: If StegX includes secure deletion features, test their effectiveness.

### 6. Network and System Monitoring Evasion

- **Test network footprint**: Verify StegX doesn't generate suspicious network traffic:
  ```python
  def test_network_footprint():
      # Monitor network connections during operation
      # Check for unexpected DNS queries or connections
  ```

- **Test system monitoring evasion**: Verify StegX doesn't trigger common security monitoring tools.

## Continuous Integration Setup for Kali Linux

To ensure ongoing test coverage and compatibility with Kali Linux, set up a CI pipeline that:

1. **Runs on Kali Linux environment**: Use Docker containers based on Kali Linux for testing.

2. **Executes the full test suite**: Run all test categories on each commit.

3. **Measures and reports coverage**: Generate and archive coverage reports.

4. **Performs security scans**: Integrate security scanning tools into the pipeline.

5. **Tests Debian package building**: Verify the package builds correctly.

Example CI configuration for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: StegX CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: kalilinux/kali-rolling
      options: --privileged
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        apt-get update
        apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-dev
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        pip3 install pytest pytest-cov bandit
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --cov=stegx_core tests/
    
    - name: Security scan
      run: |
        bandit -r stegx_project/
    
    - name: Build Debian package
      run: |
        
    - name: Upload coverage report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: coverage-report
        path: htmlcov/
```

_This testing strategy was developed and refined by the StegX team for use in real-world security environments._
